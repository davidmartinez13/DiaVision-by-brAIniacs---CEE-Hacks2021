# DiaVision-by-brAIniacs---CEE-Hacks2021
Our solution named DiaVision for the challenge #6 consists of a an app that allows medical staff or patients to take pictures of a wound and detectect it. This data would then be processed with state of the art Artificial Intelligence utilizing Computer Vision. In the future the system would produce a weekly report with diagnosis information with measurements about temperature, type of wound, size and area, that are calculated using a combination of segmentation and recognition algorithms.
